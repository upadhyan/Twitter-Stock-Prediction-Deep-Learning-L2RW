# Twitter-Stock-Prediction-Deep-Learning-L2RW
Adapted [Deep-Learning training methods developed by Uber Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09050) to create a Twitter-based stock price direction classifier. This method helps rectify the disconnect often found between a sentiment of a tweet mentioning a stock and the actual stock direction. The reweighting training method helped improve the accuracy of a CNN from around 50% to around 86%.
